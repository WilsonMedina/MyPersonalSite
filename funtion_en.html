        <h2>What is a funtion?</h2>

        &#128512;&#128512;&#128512;

        <p>
            A <strong>function</strong>, academically speaking, is a relation established between two sets <b>(X)</b>
            and <b>(F(x)=Y)</b> that assigns
            to each value of the set <b>(X)</b> (independent variable) a unique value of the second set <b>(F(x)=Y)</b>
            (dependent
            variable).<br><br>

            But we must also understand that it is a relationship, and it is given by the logical correspondence between
            the elements of two sets A, B that form ordered pairs, the formulation of an expression that joins two or
            more objects together establishes a relationship.<br><br>

            We can classify functions by:<br><br>

            <strong>Injective functions</strong>: each element of the arrival set <b>(F(x)=Y)</b> corresponds to a
            maximum of one element of the starting set <b>(X)</b>.<br><br>

            <strong>Surjective functions</strong>: each element of the arrival set <b>(F(x)=Y)</b> corresponds to at
            least one element of the starting set <b>(X)</b>.<br><br>

            <strong>Bijective functions</strong>: they are the functions that fulfill the two conditions of the
            injective and surjective functions.<br><br>

            All of the above are the academic definitions as read in different books by various authors, in this short
            article I will try to explain with a less academic dialect and a practical example how I break down how
            abstract the subject can be for some students in their initial stage. of the functions.<br><br>

            Every day we apply relationships that end up being functions, because we must always be very conceptualized
            that every function is a relationship, but every relationship is not a function.<br><br>

            When we prepare a juice at home, before processing it, we relate the ingredients that are used, it is here
            when we are applying a relationship, remember that the relationship is given by the correspondence between
            the elements, we cannot relate to make a juice, from the set of fruits a fruit &#127827; with the set of
            liquids there
            is no logical correspondence, but if we can relate the fruit &#127827; with water, remember that a function
            is used to
            assign a unique value to an independent variable <b>(X)</b> in our juice preparation that Our juice would be
            of
            unique value after being processed. It is this machine that has the formula that will be applied to our
            ingredients. This formula is simply turning a blade at a very high speed so that it crushes and makes our
            preparation homogeneous, and that is how After relating some ingredients, we convert them into a starting
            variable <b>(X)</b> that will go through a formula and end up giving us a variable of arrival
            <b>(F(x)=Y)</b> that ends up
            exemplifying a function classified as injective where the dependent or arrival variable, our juice, only
            corresponds to an independent or starting variable, our ingredients!<br><br>

            Hoping that this previous and short example helps a lot with the functions, now we will name the types of
            functions:
            <br><br><br>

            &#9989;Identity Function <br>
            &#9989;Constant function <br>
            &#9989;Lineal funtion <br>
            &#9989;Quadratic function <br>
            &#9989;Sign function <br>
            &#9989;Rational Function <br>
            &#9989;Mantissa function <br>
            &#9989;Exponential function <br>
            &#9989;Logarithmic function <br>
            &#9989;Sine function <br>
            &#9989;Cosine function <br>
            &#9989;Tangent function <br>
            &#9989;Cotangent function <br>
