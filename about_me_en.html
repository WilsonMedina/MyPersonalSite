                <p>
                    I am <strong>Wilson Medina Cárdenas</strong>, Venezuelan by birth, resident of the world and for a
                    little over 7
                    years I have lived in the beautiful city of Santiago de Chile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of my time is spent studying and teaching technology, statistics, and mathematics. oh!
                    and not least, to share with my dogs Nesky and kuky. I love them!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it has not always been like this, my life in the last decade has gone through different stages
                    that have
                    helped me grow as a person and get me to where I am now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been like a roller coaster with exciting ups and terrifying downs, the love for
                    my <strong>family</strong> in Venezuela, and knowing that I am part of their economic and emotional
                    sustenance,
                    is what in these
                    terrifying descents has not made me lose consciousness to the point of fainting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a child my greatest passion was soccer, I lived for and to play it, discipline helped me to reach
                    those training sessions and games despite living almost 2 hours away, always parallel to
                    my studies, but with the faithful conviction that I would play at a professional level. That until
                    the age of 17,
                    when I had a severe fall while playing a match, which resulted in an injury that I did not
                    I recovered but after 5 years; It was at that moment when I hit the harsh reality and
                    my dreams collapsed
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the age of 22, I entered the university to study administration specializing in
                    <strong>Marketing</strong>, when
                    I was about to complete the cycle of professional subjects to be able to graduate, I had to be part
                    of
                    Venezuelan migrants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arriving in another country to work and being able to fulfill my commitments as a resident of this
                    one, I force myself
                    for a long time to not being able to study; I could only work very hard &#128170; and without rest,
                    Only that
                    formula I take with my <strong>wife</strong> to have savings that I later invested in an SME of
                    transport and then transformed
                    at a food distributor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been this stage that introduced me to many <strong>valuable people</strong> in my life,
                    people that i
                    taught a lot and what I value most of those teachings is having discovered the beautiful and
                    infinite
                    world of <strong>technology</strong> &#128187;. That world that does not stop, that teaches you to
                    something new every day, that world
                    that keeps you in constant harmony, peace and growth, that world for which today I have the same
                    emotions, commitments and discipline of that Wilson who played soccer as a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At present I resumed my distance studies at the same university, I am already studying the
                    Last year of administration, but specialized in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. In parallel, as
                    <strong>self taught</strong> i have
                    learned a lot about various topics and it has also been an alternative that, despite not being the
                    traditional has taught me my greatest skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is at this point in my life that <strong>Steve Jobs's</strong> speech where he leaves us a
                    valuable lesson comes to mind the most:
                </p>
                <blockquote><cite>“You can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only do it looking back”</cite></blockquote>
                <p>
                    Just looking back is what helps me understand why I couldn't play professional soccer,
                    because I couldn't finish my university degree at that time, because I had to be a migrant,
                    because I met such valuable people. It is uniting all these points that gives me an answer and a
                    reason for
                    life in the present.
